# quickcommerce-v2-django

!IMPORTANT: We're currently early in the process of porting our QuickCommerce e-commerce platform to Django
and this project is not ready for third-party use.

## The FREE Headless e-Commerce and Retail API Service
QuickCommerce is a free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants who want a headless e-commerce engine 
to communicate with their e-commerce client applications, websites, and more. OpenCart provides a unique and powerful 
foundation and a FREE out-of-the-box solution for your retail store's e-commerce application needs, and comes with 
everything you need to create, scale and run your business.

QuickCommerce was designed for use with both the our Point-of-Sale App for iPad/iPad Pro and our Kiosk Terminal App 
for Android, but is free to use for any open-source projects or as a complement to your existing app.

## QuickCommerce API supports
- Multiple stores
- Customer account management with QuickBooks integration
- Product and categories (for your online store)
- Inventory management with QuickBooks integration
- Purchase orders with QuickBooks integration
- Invoicing with QuickBooks integration
- Tax rules with QuickBooks integration
- Importing your data from QuickBooks Desktop
- SSO authentication via Red Hat Keycloak

## Choose your flavor - QuickCommerce comes in multiple flavors
- Vanilla - includes functionality for Online-Retail only
- RetailPro - provides integrations with Star Micronics point-of-sale hardware including:
  - Bluetooth/WiFi cash drawers
  - bar-code scanners
  - thermal printers
- QuickCommerce Kiosk - provides functionality for your digital product distribution business
- QuickCommerce ServicePro - provides functionality for your service business
- QuickCommerce PropertyRentalPro - provides functionality for your property-rental business

### Why?
Functionally, this is a complete port of the QuickCommerce e-Commerce and e-Commerce API extension packs for OpenCart 2.x.

This re-write is the successor to the original QuickCommerce enhancement pack + OpenCart that we previously used for client projects.
This time, we're building from the ground up using Python, Django REST Framework, Swagger, and Keycloak SSO. 
And as opposed to being an extension pack, the new version of QuickCommerce is a full-fledged headless e-commerce API.
